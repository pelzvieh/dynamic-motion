# dynamic-motion
Add-on configuration for motion, to dynamically monitor on attached video cameras.

# Installation
run install_dynamic_motion.sh and hope for the best (plus open bug report if something goes wrong).

# Configuration (required!)
As the install script tells you, you need to adapt configuration, you have to manually enlist your
cameras to be supported for motion monitoring.
